OpenSleigh is a distributed saga management library, written in C# with .NET Core. 
It is intended to be reliable, fast, easy to use, configurable and extensible.

## Installation
The Core module is available [on Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenSleigh.Core/).
However, a Transport and Persistence library are necessary to properly use the library.

These are the libraries available at the moment:
- [InMemory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenSleigh.Persistence.InMemory/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenSleigh.Persistence.Mongo/)
- [MSSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenSleigh.Persistence.SQL/)
- [Azure Service Bus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenSleigh.Transport.AzureServiceBus/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenSleigh.Transport.RabbitMQ/)

## Roadmap
- add CosmosDB saga state persistence
